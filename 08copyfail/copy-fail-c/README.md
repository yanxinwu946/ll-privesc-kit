# Copy Fail (CVE-2026-31431) - C port

*[English (en)](README.md) ∙ [日本語 (ja)](README.ja.md) ∙ [简体中文 (zh-cn)](README.zh-cn.md) ∙ [한국어 (ko)](README.ko.md) ∙ [Русский (ru)](README.ru.md)*

A cross-platform C reimplementation of the Copy Fail Linux LPE (CVE-2026-31431),
disclosed 2026-04-29 by Theori / Xint. See the canonical writeup at
[copy.fail](https://copy.fail/) for the full vulnerability description, timeline,
and Theori's discovery process.

The publicly-released proof-of-concept is a 732-byte Python script. This C port
demonstrates that the same exploit can be expressed as portable C compilable to
any architecture nolibc supports, with no per-arch hex blobs or inline assembly
in the project's own source.

After `make`:

```

├── payload.o           payload wrapped as a relocatable .o by `ld -r -b binary`

├── exploit-passwd      dropper, /etc/passwd UID-flip variant
└── vulnerable          non-destructive vulnerability checker
```

`exploit.c` opens the target binary read-only, then for each 4-byte window of
the embedded payload runs one bogus AEAD-decrypt through AF_ALG whose
ciphertext input is supplied via splice() from the target's page-cache pages.
The authencesn template's in-place optimization treats the splice'd source
pages as both the ciphertext input and the plaintext destination, so the
(failing) decrypt has already overwritten the page-cache page by the time
authentication verification rejects the request. After 4 * N iterations the
target's cached image has been replaced byte-for-byte with the payload.
execve()'ing the target loads the mutated pages; the on-disk inode is still
setuid root, so the kernel grants root credentials and runs the payload.

`payload.c` is plain portable C: `setgid(0); setuid(0); execve("/bin/sh",
...)`. nolibc supplies the `_start`, the syscall machinery, and the per-arch
register-juggling.

A second variant, `exploit-passwd.c`, mutates four bytes of /etc/passwd's page
cache instead of a setuid binary's image. It needs no embedded payload and
works on systems where the binary-mutation route is blocked, but its cashout
surface is much narrower.

`vulnerable.c` is not an exploit. It creates a local `testfile` containing the
string `init`, then runs the same `patch_chunk()` primitive against that file's
own page cache to overwrite the bytes with `vulnerable`. If the read-back
contents match, the running kernel is in-window for CVE-2026-31431. The
on-disk inode is never modified; `testfile` is removed on exit; the page-cache
mutation evaporates with it. Runs unprivileged. Exits 100 if vulnerable, 0
if the primitive ran but the mutation did not take, 2 if the AF_ALG socket
family or authencesn template is unavailable so patch state cannot be
determined, and 1 for other runtime errors.


## Build

Default (host-arch native):

```sh
make
```

Cross-compile to aarch64 (or any other Linux arch a cross-toolchain is
installed for):

```sh
make CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc LD=aarch64-linux-gnu-ld
```

Architectures supported by the vendored nolibc (per upstream): x86_64, i386,
arm, aarch64, riscv32/64, mips, ppc, s390x, loongarch, m68k, sh, sparc.
nolibc dispatches on the compiler's arch macros, so picking the right
`CC`/`LD` is sufficient.

Required to build:

* a C compiler (`cc`, `gcc`, or any cross variant)
* a linker that supports `ld -r -b binary` (binutils ld and lld both do)
* kernel UAPI headers providing `linux/if_alg.h` and `<asm/unistd.h>`
  (Debian/Ubuntu: `linux-libc-dev`; cross variants: typically pulled in by
  the cross-toolchain package)

Header sets older than Linux 5.6 predate `__kernel_old_time_t` and
`struct __kernel_old_timespec`, which the vendored nolibc uses. `compat.h`
(force-included into the payload build) supplies them when absent, so an
older `linux-libc-dev` still builds. It is a no-op on 5.6+ headers.

There are no external library dependencies. The payload is built freestanding
against nolibc; the dropper links against the host libc only for `fprintf`
and `perror`.


## Architectural choices

A few small toolchain features carry most of the weight in keeping the source
portable and the payload small.

### nolibc

`nolibc/` is the kernel's tiny header-only libc replacement, vendored from
torvalds/linux `tools/include/nolibc/`. It provides `_start`, a portable
`syscall()` macro, and inline syscall wrappers, with the per-arch register
conventions encoded in `nolibc/arch-*.h`. Building the payload with
`-nostdlib -static -ffreestanding -Inolibc` produces a tiny static ELF that
calls into the kernel directly without dragging in glibc startup, TLS init,
or stack-canary plumbing. Result once packed and section-stripped (both
below): ~720 bytes on x86_64, ~1.2 KB on aarch64, versus ~17 KB for the same
`payload.c` linked against musl-static or ~700 KB against glibc-static.

### `ld -r -b binary` for embedding

The Makefile turns the built `payload` ELF into `payload.o` via `ld -r -b
binary -o payload.o payload`. The linker emits the input bytes verbatim as
the data section of a relocatable object file and synthesizes three symbols
from the input filename:

```
_binary_payload_start    address of first payload byte
_binary_payload_end      address one past the last payload byte
_binary_payload_size     absolute symbol whose value is the size in bytes
```

`exploit.c` declares the first two as `extern const unsigned char[]` and
computes the size as `_binary_payload_end - _binary_payload_start`.

### `-Wl,-N` plus tight `max-page-size`

The payload is statically linked with `-Wl,-N -Wl,-z,max-page-size=0x10`,
which collapses `.text`/`.rodata`/`.data` into a single LOAD segment with
16-byte file-alignment instead of the kernel-page-aligned 4 KB-per-segment
default. This produces an "RWX permissions" warning from `ld`, which is
informational only - the payload's runtime memory protection doesn't matter to
its single-purpose program. Without this flag, the same code links to ~13 KB
on x86_64 (mostly inter-segment zero padding); with it, ~1.3 KB before the
section-header strip below.

### Stripping section headers

After linking, `objcopy --strip-section-headers` removes the payload's section
header table and `.shstrtab`. The kernel ELF loader maps a program from its
program headers alone, so those bytes never load at runtime, and because
`payload` is embedded verbatim they also inflate the drop and the
`patch_chunk` iteration count. Stripping them takes the x86_64 payload from
~1.3 KB to 720 bytes (322 four-byte iterations down to 180). Two link-time
flags shave the rest: `-Wl,--build-id=none` drops the build-id note, and
`-fcf-protection=none` drops the x86 CET note where the compiler supports it.

The strip needs binutils >= 2.40. Cross builds pass the target's objcopy via
`OBJCOPY=` (e.g. `OBJCOPY=aarch64-linux-gnu-objcopy`); when objcopy cannot do
it, the build prints a note and keeps a valid, larger payload.


## Variants and cashout viability

This repository ships two exploit variants that share the AF_ALG/splice
page-cache mutation primitive but cash out into root execution differently.
Their reliability profiles are not equivalent, and the difference matters
when reasoning about real-world threat models.

### Binary-mutation variant (`exploit`)

Mutates the page cache of a target setuid binary with the embedded payload
bytes, then execs the binary. The kernel grants root credentials from the
binary's untouched on-disk setuid bit, loads the corrupted in-memory image,
and runs the payload.

Works wherever the attacker can `open(target, O_RDONLY)` for any root-setuid
binary on the system. More or less defeated by environments that gate setuid
binaries behind restricted-read directories and by setuid-free system designs.

### /etc/passwd UID-flip variant (`exploit-passwd`)

Mutates four bytes of /etc/passwd's page cache to set the running user's UID
field to "0000". /etc/passwd is world-readable on every standard Linux system,
so the *mutation* is universal. Translating it into root execution depends on
some root-side process resolving the user via getpwnam/getpwuid and acting on
the resolved uid without cross-validation. Many such consumers exist; many of
them defensively cross-check against the kernel's view of the calling uid or
against on-disk file ownership, breaking the cashout.

#### Cashout viability matrix

| Cashout | Pre-root setup needed | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| WSL2 session spawn | No | WSL's per-session `setuid(getpwnam(default_user)->pw_uid)` does no validation. Works cleanly. |
| util-linux `su` | No | Permissive caller-identity handling. |
| shadow-utils `su` | Yes | `getpwuid(getuid())` caller-identity check fails because the mutation unmaps the real uid. |
| sshd (default `StrictModes yes`) | Yes (disable StrictModes) | StrictModes requires the home dir to be owned by root or `pw->pw_uid`. Mutation makes pw_uid=0; on-disk owner stays at original uid; mismatch refuses auth. |
| MTA local delivery (postfix, exim, etc.) | Variable | Depends on the MDA's home-perm validation. Test per MTA. |

#### Pivoting after `su` fails

`exploit-passwd` execs `su <user>` after mutating, as the simplest possible
cashout. That works against util-linux `su` but fails against shadow-utils `su`
with "Cannot determine your user name." The page cache mutation is still in
place at that point, and pivoting to any other cashout (e.g. using a daemon
resolving users via getpwnam without cross-checking) is possible at that point.
Run `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` as root to clear the corrupted page
cache when done testing.

```

In between: every major distro kernel that didn't backport the fix.
Ubuntu, RHEL, SUSE, Amazon Linux, and Debian were all confirmed vulnerable
in their stock cloud-image kernels at disclosure time. Distro-level
backports started rolling out around 2026-04-29 alongside the public
disclosure. To verify whether a target kernel is in-window, check whether
`a664bf3d603d` (or its distro-specific backport) is present in the kernel's
git log or the distro's changelog.
